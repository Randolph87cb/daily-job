### Problem Statement

The Kingdom of AtCoder has $N$ cities, called city $1,2,\dots,N$. There are $M$ bidirectional roads connecting pairs of cities, where the $i$\-th road connects cities $U_i$ and $V_i$. Any pair of cities can be reached from each other by traversing some roads.

In the Kingdom of AtCoder, a week consists of $W$ days. A week proceeds through days $1,2,\dots,W$, and the day after day $W$ is day $1$.

Each city has certain days of the week that are holidays. The holiday information for city $i$ is given as a string $S_i$ of length $W$: if the $j$\-th character of $S_i$ is `o`, day $j$ is a holiday; if it is `x`, day $j$ is a weekday.

Takahashi chooses a city he likes and visits it at noon on day $1$. Each night thereafter, he repeatedly chooses to either stay in his current city or move to a city directly connected by a road. Output `Yes` if it is possible for him to keep moving so that the city he is in at noon every day is a holiday, and `No` otherwise.

$T$ test cases are given; solve each of them.

### Constraints

-   $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$
-   $1 \leq N \leq 10^5$
-   $N-1 \leq M \leq 10^5$
-   $1 \leq U_i \lt V_i \leq N$
-   Any pair of cities can be reached from each other by traversing some roads.
-   $2 \leq W \leq 10$
-   $T,N,M,U_i,V_i,W$ are integers.
-   $S_i$ is a string of length $W$ consisting of `o`, `x`.
-   The sum of $N$ over all test cases is at most $10^5$.
-   The sum of $M$ over all test cases is at most $10^5$.

### Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```text
$T$
$\mathrm{case}_1$
$\mathrm{case}_2$
$\vdots$
$\mathrm{case}_T$
```

Here, $\mathrm{case}_i$ denotes the input for the $i$\-th test case. Each test case is given in the following format:

```text
$N$ $M$
$U_1$ $V_1$
$U_2$ $V_2$
$\vdots$
$U_M$ $V_M$
$W$
$S_1$
$S_2$
$\vdots$
$S_N$
```

### Output

Output $T$ lines. The $i$\-th line should contain the answer for the $i$\-th test case.

### Sample Input 1

```text

```

### Sample Output 1

```text
Yes
Yes
No
```

For the first test case, for example, the condition can be satisfied by repeatedly moving along cities $4 \to 2 \to 1 \to 4 \to 2 \to 1 \to \cdots$. Alternatively, the condition can also be satisfied by repeatedly moving along cities $3 \to 2 \to 3 \to 3 \to 2 \to 3 \to \cdots$.

For the second test case, the condition can be satisfied by staying in city $1$ indefinitely.

For the third test case, it is impossible to keep moving while satisfying the condition.
