### Problem Statement

You are given a string $S$ consisting of `a`, `b`, `c`.

Find the number of non-empty **substrings** of $S$ in which no two adjacent characters are the same, modulo $998244353$.

Two substrings are considered distinct if they are taken from different positions, even if they are identical as strings.

**What is a substring?**

A **substring** of $S$ is a string obtained by deleting zero or more characters from the beginning and zero or more characters from the end of $S$. For example, `ab` is a substring of `abc`, but `ac` is not a substring of `abc`.

### Constraints

-   $S$ is a string of length between $1$ and $3 \times 10^5$, inclusive, consisting of `a`, `b`, `c`.

### Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```text
$S$
```

### Output

Output the answer.

### Sample Input 1

```text
abbc
```

### Sample Output 1

```text
6
```

The substrings in which no two adjacent characters are the same are the following six:

-   `a` (from the $1$st to the $1$st character of $S$)
-   `b` (from the $2$nd to the $2$nd character of $S$)
-   `b` (from the $3$rd to the $3$rd character of $S$)
-   `c` (from the $4$th to the $4$th character of $S$)
-   `ab` (from the $1$st to the $2$nd character of $S$)
-   `bc` (from the $3$rd to the $4$th character of $S$)

Note that, as with the $2$nd and $3$rd entries, two substrings are considered distinct if they are taken from different positions, even if they are identical as strings.

### Sample Output 2
